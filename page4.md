# Interpretation

The topic modelling and contingency approach we used succeeded in identifying distinctly separate marijuana legalization conversations occurring in California versus Arizona newspapers. For California, words associated with marijuana tended to relate to regulation, law and order and judicial issues. For Arizona, stories on marijuana tended to discus voting, border control and business issues. These were the respective orientations public newspapers in each state published in the two years leading up to and one month after the vote on legalization. Though comparative sentiment analysis turned out to be very similar in both states, the diverging topic clusters in the two comparable states implies that certain arguments for and against the legalization of marijuana may be stronger than others. 

Clearly our results were limitated by our dataset. It is particularly evident in one area of our contingency matrix. The topic 'business' that was derived from topic modeling, was stood out in Arizona as being quite frequent. This is probably because the three newspapers in Factiva from Arizona were business oriented newspapers.
