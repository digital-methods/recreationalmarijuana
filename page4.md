## Conclusion on topic modeling:

We conclude that the topics ‘regulation’, ‘law and order’, ‘voting’ and ‘border control’ are interesting and well established. With the topic ‘judicial’ and ‘business’ we are more cautious and need to look into specific cases. We could not interpret ‘Religion and education’ and ‘event, lifestyle, education’ in a meaningful way. Furthermore, we had two other topics (number 9 and 10) which had no meaning at all. We labeled them as ‘none’.

## Conclusion on Contingency Matrix:

All three topics ‘regulation’, ‘law and order’ and ‘judicial’ seem to be more frequent in the Californa newspapers than in Arizona. On the other hand, ‘voting’, ‘border control’ and ‘business’ is stronger represented in Arizona’s newspapers than in California’s.
