## Cannabis in the US
	Possession or sale of cannabis in the United States is prohibited by federal law. 
•	In 1970, Controlled Substances Act established marijuana as a Schedule I Drug. Basically, meaning the US government defines marijuana as having no medical value whatsoever. Schedule 1 status also restricts almost all medical research, for instance right now almost all medical cannabis for research purposes, the little that is allowed comes from U of Miss. 
•	There have been efforts recently in the US Congress, unsuccessfully so far, to change its designation. 
•	Federal and state law obviously don’t line up here. It’s a state’s rights issue that really hasn’t gone before the Supreme Court although a few cases have made it to lower federal courts. Congress did pass a law recently (that must be annually renewed) that  

As of 2018, there are 9 states plus DC that have legalized recreational use and possession of a certain amount of marijuana. 
•	9 states have legalized the recreational sale of marijuana while others have legalized medical use or decriminalized possession. 
•	Those 9 states are– Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington – the sale and possession of marijuana is legal for both medical and recreational use
•	Vermont and the District of Columbia have legalized personal use but not commercial sale.
•	Twenty-nine states, including the ones mentioned before plus DC, have passed laws allowing some degree of medical use of marijuana, and 13 states have taken steps to decriminalize it to some degree. 
o	That amount that one can possess legally, cultivation, and the quantity of THC differs by state, if amongst those that have legalized it recreationally. 
•	Some city governments have established laws decriminalizing possession of cannabis as well. Going from a misdemeanor to a civil infraction i.e. ticket. 

## History in CA

•	Directly following Controlled Substances Act in 1970, CA voters then rejected a prop in 1972 which would have fully decriminalization marijuana under California law.  In 1976 though the governor reduced the penalty for possession of marijuana from a felony to a misdemeanor.
•	Nov 1996: California legalized medical marijuana (Prop 215)
o	Passed by initiative process, and passed with (55.6%) votes in favor and (44.4%) against.
o	Prop 215 was the first medical marijuana ballot initiative passed at the state level
o	Although this led to quasi-recreational use system

•	Nov. 2016: California voters approved the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (Proposition 64) to legalize the recreational use of cannabis
o	Passed with 57% to 42.9%
o	It allows for the possession, sale, tax, regulation, and cultivation. 

## History in AZ
Proposition 200 (1996)- grey area
•	65% of Arizona voters approved Proposition 200, a drug policy reform initiative containing a provision allowing the use of cannabis with a doctor's prescription.
o	Repealed by state legislators a few months after
o	The change was rejected by voters in a subsequent referendum
o	The medical marijuana provision was ineffective and created an impasse 

•	Tried again to legalize 2002 and then in 2010 to legalize the medical use of cannabis 
o	Failed with 42.7% - 2002
o	Passed with 50.1% - 2010

•	Proposition 205 in 2016 to legalize the recreational use of cannabis 
o	Failed with 48.7%
o	Law was a little different than CA but not gravely 


## Why we chose AZ and CA:
•	Neighboring states
•	While CA is 5 times the size of AZ (population), they have similar demographics, specially in terms of growth and minority makeup. 
•	Both deal with a Mexican border which is a significant narrative related to marijuana usage i.e. its connection to organized crime
•	They both passed medical marijuana laws through a voter referendum in 1996 (albeit one that ended up being useless in AZ because of state legislator  
•	Both had 2016 rec marijuana prop on ballot that were quite similar ie possession, sale, tax, regulation, and cultivation
•	That said, they also have significant ideological differences. AZ is seen as one of the most conservative law and order states in the country.
o	 It is more conservative generally than CA.
