# Methodology

## Topic Modeling
We identified and interpreted 8 different topics. Relevance metric is kept at λ=0.4.

## 1) Regulation
20 most relevant words: marijuana, medical, dispensary, city, cannabis, pot, would, said, use, measure, law, recreational, council, patient, initiative, legal, state, cultivation, regulation, ordinance

Words such as dispensary, medial, measure, law, council, initiative or legal lead us to interpret this topic as regulation centered. One can imagine that the discourse about recreational marijuana legalisation triggered questions such as how recreational marijuana is administered (who will administer and under what regulatory framework), who will have access, under which circumstances one will have access (what medical problems) and so on.

At the same time, this topic contains some noise such as would or said. However, we considered this noise of being relatively small and thus think the ‘Regulaion’ topic has high explanatory value.

## 2) Law and Order
20 most relevant words: fire, police, said, man, arrested, reported, vehicle, block, officer, deputy, found, country, suspect, suspicion, road, stolen, authority, sheriff, crash, shasta

Words such as police, arrested, officer, deputy, suspect, stolen or sheriff lead us to interpret this topic as centered around domestic law and order. It is marked by the discussion of how order can be sustained even with a partial legalisation of a drug. It could be driven by fears that recreational marijuana legalisation would attract additional crime and thus needs close supervision. Also news about crimes with possession of marijuana fall in this topic.

Noise is very low in this topic. It consists of the usual words such as said or near. We thus conclude that this topic has high explanatory value.

## 3) Religion and Education 
20 most relevant words: student, it, school, church, people, life, like, thing, kid, im, me, know, get, really, he, cook, love, there, thought, say

No clear pattern can be identified in this topic. It seems to contain two different topics, one marked by education (student, school) and one marked by religion (church, christian).

Furthermore, this topics contains a high amount of noise words, which cannot be successfully classified, such as people, like, thing, know, get, really, he, there or say. We thus conclude that this topic has only limited explanatory value.

## 4) Voting
20 most relevant words: percent, republican, voter, trump, candidate, poll, political, democrat, state, vote, election, yes, senate, clinton, housing, environmental, tax, democratic, campaign, sander

Words such as republican, voter, candidate, poll, political, vote, election or campaign led us to interpret this topic as centered around voting processes. Ideally, this topic is all about how the voting outcome has been for the laws aiming at recreational marijuana legalisation, or about forecasts for future voting.

This topic contains a relatively small amount of noise words. We thus think that the voting topic has high explanatory value.

## 5) Business
20 most relevant words: company, article, business, executive, firm, journal, anacstpd, bizjournalscomsubscribe, 18668533661, useful, partner, investment, technology, capital, investor, ceo, visit, chairman, president

Words such as company, business, firm, investment, capital or investment lead us to conclude that this topic is centered around a business aspect. It could be about how much revenue recreational marijuana would generate, what kind of businesses would be allowed to produce marijuana, what prices it would be sold or what market design recreational marijuana should have.

This topic contains few, but extraordinary noise words, such as bizjournalscomsubscribeI or 18668533661. We thus conclude that this topic has high explanatory value, are however cautious about its interpretation.

## 6) Event, Lifestyle, and Enviroment
20 most relevant words: tree, plant, weed, event, redding, festival, music, pm, soil, water, band, ave, saturday, spring, garden, feature, painting, st, concert, book

Words like event, festival, music and band seem to suggest that it contains festivals or free time activities. Also garden and painting would point in this direction. However, there are also words which could point at the cultivation of cannabis or its environmental impact, such as plant, three, water or soil. Because the topic is not clear but noise words are only a few, we conclude that this topic has medium explanatory value.

## 7) Judical
20 most relevant words: prosecutor, capello, trial, video, murder, inmate, nayen, jail, attorney, dwyer, pappa, joseph, testified, escape, judge, raid, lopez, prison, testimony, court

World like prosecutor, trial murder, inmate, jail, attorney, testified, judge, testimony or court let us to conclude that this topic is mostly about judicial affairs. It could be closely related to the ‘law and order’ topic.

This topic however contains a considerable amount of noise words, such as video, nayeri, dwyer, pappa or joseph, which makes it rather difficult to interpret clearly. We thus conclude that this topic has only medium explanatory value.

## 8) Border Control
20 most relevant words: border, agent, drug, fence, patrol, marinovich, mexico, drone, nogales, mexican, smuggling, seized, cocaine, sector, enforcement, offender, rancher, sonora, cbp, tucson

Worlds like border, drug, fence, patrol, mexico or smuggling leads us to conclude that this topic talk about border issues such as illegal traffic. It is rather clear in this respect, with only little noise words or words pointing at a different interpretation of this topic. We thus conclude that it has high explanatory value.

## 9 and 10) no relevant topic
We did not find any pattern for these topics. One seems to contain Spanish words, the other seems to contain only noise words. We thus excluded these two topics from our further analysis by labelling them with 'none'.
