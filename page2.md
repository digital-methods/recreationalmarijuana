# Methodology

Research objective

At the example of recreational marijuana legalisation in the United States, we analyse the effect of media on voters behaviour. The main rationale behind such an analysis is that voters are deciding on the basis of information provided through media, and are therefore  not only affected by the choice of media source through which they stay up to date, but also through the overall presentation of information by different media sources.

We therefore look at the correlation between how media sources talk about political issues and the voterâ€™s behaviour and thus poll outcomes.

 
 Still pretty much empty except for this illustration:
