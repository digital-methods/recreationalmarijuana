# Methodology

## Why we chose AZ and CA:
•	Neighboring states
•	While CA is 5 times the size of AZ (population), they have similar demographics, specially in terms of growth and minority makeup. 
•	Both deal with a Mexican border which is a significant narrative related to marijuana usage i.e. its connection to organized crime
•	They both passed medical marijuana laws through a voter referendum in 1996 (albeit one that ended up being useless in AZ because of state legislator  
•	Both had 2016 rec marijuana prop on ballot that were quite similar ie possession, sale, tax, regulation, and cultivation
•	That said, they also have significant ideological differences. AZ is seen as one of the most conservative law and order states in the country.
o	 It is more conservative generally than CA. 


## Research Objective

At the example of recreational marijuana legalisation in the United States, we analyse the effect of media on voters behaviour. The main rationale behind such an analysis is that voters are deciding on the basis of information provided through media, and are therefore  not only affected by the choice of media source through which they stay up to date, but also through the overall presentation of information by different media sources.

We therefore look at the correlation between how media sources talk about political issues and the voter’s behaviour and thus poll outcomes.
