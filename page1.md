## Cannabis in the US
Marijuana legalization is one of the most controversial policy issues in the US
- Touches upon legal, policy, science, health, medical, individual rights, states rights, etc.
- Marijuana is the most frequently used illegal drug in the United States (American Public Health Association, 2014)  
- The United States is the world’s leading per capita marijuana consumer (WHO, 2008).
- Among drug-related arrests, 38.6% were for marijuana possession and 4.6% were for marijuana sale or manufacturing (FBI, 2015).

- In 1970, the Controlled Substances Act established marijuana as a Schedule I Drug. Basically, the designation meant the US Government defined marijuana as having no medical value whatsoever. Schedule 1 status also restricts almost all medical research.
- There have been efforts recently in the US Congress, unsuccessfully so far, to change its designation. 
- Federal and state law obviously don’t line up here. It’s a state’s rights issue that really hasn’t gone before the Supreme Court although a few cases have made it to lower federal courts.

	Possession or sale of cannabis is prohibited by federal law but for states.... 

##### States' Rights
As of 2018, there are 9 states plus DC that have legalized recreational use and possession of a certain amount of marijuana. 
- 9 states have legalized the recreational sale of marijuana. Other states have legalized medical use or decriminalized possession. 
- Sale and possesion are legal for recreational use in Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.
- Vermont and the District of Columbia have legalized personal. They have not legalized the sale and/or commercial industry.
- Of the 50 states in the US, 29 states including the ones listed above and DC, have passed laws allowing some amount of medical marijuana usage. 13 more states have decriminalize it to some degree. 
- Some city governments have established laws decriminalizing possession of cannabis as well i.e.from a misdemeanor to a civil infraction like a ticket. 

## History in CA
- Directly following Controlled Substances Act in 1970, CA voters  rejected a proposition in 1972 which would have fully decriminalization marijuana under California law.  In 1976 however, the governor of CA reduced the penalty for possession of marijuana from a felony to a misdemeanor.
- Nov 1996: California legalized medical marijuana (Prop 215). It passed by initiative process, and passed with 55.6% votes in favor and 44.4% against. Prop 215 was the first medical marijuana ballot initiative passed at the state level. Although this led to quasi-recreational use system. 
- Nov. 2016: California voters approved the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (Proposition 64) to legalize the recreational use of cannabis. It passed with a tally of 57% to 42.9%. It allows for possession, sale, tax, regulation, and cultivation. 

## History in AZ
- 65% of Arizona voters approved Proposition 200 in 1996. It allowed medical marijuana, although strictly. It was repealed by state legislators a few months after. The change was rejected by voters in a subsequent referendum. This led to a grey area and ultimate impasse. 
- AZ again tried again to legalize medical marijuana in 2002 (failed with 42.7%) and then in 2010 (passed with 50.1%) to legalize the medical use of cannabis.
- Proposition 205 in 2016 (failed with 48.7%) to legalize the recreational use of cannabis. Law was a little different than CA but not substantially.
