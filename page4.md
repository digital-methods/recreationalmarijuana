# Interpretation

By looking at the raw headlines and article data, we developed a better understanding of our cluster topics identified through tools such as topic modeling and the contingency matrix.

In California, the “regulation” cluster seems to address the new wave of legislation designed to refine the parameters of previous marijuana legalization laws, such as addressing the “rules for growing marijuana.” The “law and order” cluster likely derives from discussions on the impact of state legalization on federal laws and on criminal reforms. The “judicial” cluster in California newspapers is similar but there is more noise from several articles announcing the arrests of people connected to the drug trade. Taken together, at the time of the vote, Californian newspapers paint a picture of a state with an already robust and legitimate pot industry, with the focus on how to move even more forward in refining legal frameworks regulating the market. 

In contrast, Arizona newspaper clusters show different qualitative themes. As expected, there is substantial noise in Arizona’s “voting” cluster. This reflects the status of Arizona as a swing state, and the predominance of bipartisan views on marijuana legalization. As expected, “border control” topics in Arizona newspapers are often linked to drug cartels and illegal smuggling of marijuana. Articles in the “business” cluster reflect business-focused opposition to marijuana legalization, such as the opposition of “powerful business group” and “some smoke shops.” We can infer that at the time of voting, Arizona newspaper articles reflected a strongly divided swing state on the issue of marijuana legalization, with a focus on increased crime around the border with Mexico and also economic arguments for and against legalization. Most intriguing is that a quick scan of the headlines show that they are not all anti-legalization – there simply exists more coverage of movements against marijuana legalization than in California.

Our results were limitated by our dataset. It is particularly evident in one area of our contingency matrix. The topic 'business' that was derived from topic modeling, stood out significantly in Arizona. This is probably because the three newspapers in Factiva from Arizona were business oriented newspapers.  

In sum, the topic modelling and contingency approach we used succeeded in identifying distinctly separate marijuana legalization conversations occurring in California versus Arizona newspapers. For California, words associated to marijuana tended to relate to regulation, law and order and judicial issues. For Arizona, stories on marijuana tended to discus voting, and border control. These were the respective orientations public newspapers in each state published in the two years leading up to and one month after the vote on legalization. Though comparative sentiment analysis turned out to be very similar in both states, the diverging topic clusters in the two comparable states implies that certain arguments against the legalization of marijuana could be stronger than others in persuading the public to vote against it. That said, it also must be considered that prevailing topics like 'border security' in Arizona, a highly politicized and well documented topic  within the public discourse in Arizona for years, may have an impact on newspapers in terms of what topics they chose to write about.
